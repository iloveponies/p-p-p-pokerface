;; To get the rank, youâ€™ll need to convert a character into an integer. To see if a character is a digit, like \5 or \2, you can use (Character/isDigit char):
;; (Character/isDigit \5) ;=> true
;; (Character/isDigit \A) ;=> false
;; If a character is a digit, you can use (Integer/valueOf string) to convert it to an integer. You will first have to convert the character into a string.
;; (Integer/valueOf "12")     ;=> 12
;; (Integer/valueOf (str \5)) ;=> 5
;; Finally, to turn the characters T, J, Q, K and A into integers, using a map to store the values is very useful:
;; (get {\A 100, \B 20} \B) ;=> 20
;; ({\A 100, \B 20} \B) ;=> 20
;; (def replacements {\A 100, \B 20})
;; (replacements \B) ;=> 20
;;

;; Exercise 2
;; Write the function (rank card) which takes a single card and returns the rank as a number between 2 and 14.
;;
;; string -> integer
;; Get first element, assess digit or character, return as digit if digit, convert to digit if chracter
